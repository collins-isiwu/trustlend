## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project locally, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>=3.11.4)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- A Database System (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) 

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/collins-isiwu/trustlend.git


2. Change into the parent directory:

        cd trustlend


3. Set up a virtual environment:

        python3 -m venv venv


4. Activate your virtual environment:

        source venv/bin/activate


5. Install the Python dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt


6. Create a .env file and set neccessary secret keys below:


7. Apply migrations to create the database schema:

        python3 manage.py migrate


8. Start the development server: 
 ```
 Flask run
 ```

The API should now be running locally at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).


# Commit Standards

## Branches

- **dev** -> pr this branch for everything `backend` related
- **main** -> **dont touch** this branch, this is what is running in production!

## Contributions

farmdine-backend is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let us know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/collins-isiwu/trustlend.git`.
2. Open your terminal & set the origin branch: `git remote add origin https://github.com/collins-isiwu/trustlend.git`
3. Pull origin `git pull origin dev`
4. Create a new branch for the task you were assigned to, eg `TicketNumber/(Feat/Bug/Fix/Chore)/Ticket-title` : `git checkout -b BA-001/Feat/Sign-Up-from`
5. After making changes, do `git add .`
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message : `git commit -m "your commit message"`.
7. To make sure there are no conflicts, run `git pull origin dev`.
8. Push changes to your new branch, run `git push -u origin feat-csv-parser`.
9. Create a pull request to the `dev` branch not `main`.
10. Ensure to describe your pull request.
11. > If you've added code that should be tested, add some test examples.


# Merging
Under any circumstances should you merge a pull request on a specific branch to the `dev` or `main` branch

> _Sample Commit Messages_

- `chore: Updated README file`:= `chore` is used because the commit didn't make any changes to the backend or test folders in any way.
- `feat: Added plugin info endpoints`:= `feat` is used here because the feature was non-existent before the commit.
